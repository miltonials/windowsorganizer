# File organizer by extension

The `organizer.bat` script goes through all files in the folder it is in, ignores the script file and creates subfolders for each file extension found. The files are moved to these corresponding subfolders. This makes it easier to organize and manage files by grouping them by type.

## How to use

1. **Download the file**: Clone or download the repository.
2. **Locate the script**: Make sure the `organizer.bat` file is in the folder you want to organize.
3. **Run the script**: Double click on the `organizer.bat` file to run it.

   - The script will go through all the files in the current folder.
   - It will create subfolders for each file extension.
   - It will move the files to the corresponding subfolders.
   - When finished, press Enter to close the script.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system.

## Notes

- The script will not move the script file (`organizer.bat`).
- If a subfolder already exists for an extension, the script will not recreate it.
